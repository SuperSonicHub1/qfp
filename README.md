# qfp
Qfp is a python library for creating audio fingerprints that are robust to alterations in pitch and speed. This method is ideal for ID'ing music from recordings such as DJ sets where the tracks are commonly played at a different pitch or speed than the original recording. Qfp is an implementation of the audio fingerprinting/recognition algorithms detailed in a 2016 academic paper by Reinhard Sonnleitner and Gerhard Widmer [[1]](http://www.cp.jku.at/research/papers/Sonnleitner_etal_DAFx_2014.pdf).

## Quickstart
Install by cloning the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mbortnyck/qfp/
```

You can create a fingerprint from your reference audio

```python
from qfp import ReferenceFingerprint

fp_r = ReferenceFingerprint("Prince_-_Kiss.mp3")
fp_r.create()
```

... or a query fingerprint from an audio clip that you wish to identify.

```python
from qfp import QueryFingerprint

fp_q = QueryFingerprint("unknown_audio.wav")
fp_q.create()
```

The QfpDB can store reference fingerprints and lookup query fingerprints.
```python
from qfp.db import QfpDB

db = QfpDB()
db.store(fp_r, "Prince - Kiss")
```

```python
fp_q = QueryFingerprint("kiss_pitched_up.mp3")
fp_q.create()
db.query(fp_q)
fp.matches
```
```python
[Match(record=u'Prince - Kiss', offset=0, vScore=0.7077922077922078)]
```

Qfp currently accepts recordings in [any format that ffmpeg can handle](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats).
